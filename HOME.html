	<h2>Definition and Meaning</h2>
	<p>

The term "craft" denotes a skill, usually employed in branches of the decorative arts (eg. ceramics), or in an associated artistic practice (eg. lace-making). A key feature of crafts is that they involve a high degree of "hands-on" craftsmanship (hence the colloquial term "handicrafts) rather than just skill with a machine.

Some crafts that are practiced by artists working alone are sometimes referred to by the vague term "studio craft". Metal work, wood turning, glass blowing, and glass art are examples of "studio crafts", as is pottery - notably the studio pottery movement exemplified by Bernard Leach in Britain.</p>

 Arts describes a wide variety of activities involving making things with one's own hands. Arts and crafts is usually a hobby. Some crafts (art skills) have been practised since preshistoric times, others are more recent inventions. William Morris, John Ruskin and others promoted an "arts and crafts" movement in the late 19th century, which popularized the phrase.

Both children and adults enjoy arts and crafts. Children in schools may learn skills such as woodworking, wood carving, sewing, or making things with all sorts of material. Many community centres and schools have evening or day classes and workshops where one can learn arts and craft skills.</p1>
